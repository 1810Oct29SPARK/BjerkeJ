        <h2>SEALAB 3</h2>
        <p>Using the refurbished SEALAB 2 vessel, SEALAB 3 was located off San Clemente Island, California. The depth was at 185 meters, about three times as deep as the previous 
            expedition. Five teams of nine divers each were to spend 12 days in the habitat. Before the expedition even began , there were some issues. The heating mechanism did not work
            properly in the pod they used to get underwater which means that the divers were freezing cold even before they made it to the habitat. They also had issues getting the entry hatch to the 
            habitat open. They gave up and began the ascension back to the surface in the pod. The divers were very cold but still wanted to continue, even despite finding a leak. 
            They lowered the pod again and two divers left the pod to work on the issues while the other two were inside the pod. Bob Barth and Barry Cannon swim towards the hatch 
            to try and open it. Before Barth could make any progress, he hears something in the water. He leaves the hatch and finds Cannon convulsing. With no way to communicate 
            between divers, Barth had no idea what to do. He could not radio in for help or even yell back to the pod, they are underwater. The only thing he could do was to 
            pull Cannon back to the pod but he did not have the strength. Barth swims back alone and another diver, Blackburn, was suited up and goes to get Cannon. After getting everyone
            back in to the pod, they began to return back to the surface. Unfortunately, Cannon died before they got back. </p>
        <p>As the Navy underwent an investigation, the program was on hold. </p>
