        <h2>SEALAB 1</h2>
        <p>The first experiments was conducted off the coast of Bermuda, beginning on July 20th, 1964. SEALAB 1 was a submarine-like habitat that was 
            about 40 feet long and 9 feet high. It was lowered to 58 meters below sea level and was held in place by axles from railroad cars. Four brave divers took part in this experiment: 
            LCDR Robert Thompson, MC; Gunners Mate First Class Lester Anderson, Chief Quartermaster Robert A. Barth, and Chief Hospital Corpsman Sanders Manning. They were to be 
            underwater for three weeks. </p>
        <p>Despite the experiments ending short due to a tropical storm, it was a huge success. The four divers stayed underwater for 11 straight days. They were not in water this entire time,
            but the container they were in was pressurized to the same pressure that the water was at that depth. This allowed the divers to easily exit the container to complete expeditions
            and return without having to decompress. </p><br>
