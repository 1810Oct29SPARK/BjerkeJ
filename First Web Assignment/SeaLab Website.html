        <p>In October of 1957, the Soviet Union launched the first successful satellite into orbit, Sputnik 1. This success led to the Space Race between the United States 
            and the Soviet Union accelerating tremendously. However, during this same time, President John F. Kennedy believed that the unexplored oceans were just as 
            important as the space around us. As the race to the moon continued, scientists were concerned about making sure humans could live in space. They worried about 
            low gravity, radiation, compressed living courters and many other things. The US Navy, however, were also concerned about how people could survive underwater. 
            Thus, the SEALAB experiments began and the first test began in July of 1964. </p>
        <p>The idea behind these experiments came from the Senior Medical Officer in the Navy, "Papa Topside" George F. Bond. He created the concept of saturation diving which involved
            a diver being under high pressures for extended periods of time. With any diver, as they resurface, they need to slowly get used to the change in pressure. 
            Decompression chambers are often used to accomplish this. If a diver did not properly decompress, the body could be terribly damaged which could result in death. Bond 
            believed that the same concept for getting used to normal atmospheric pressure after diving could be used for going to higher pressures. Once a body got used to the 
            higher pressure, they could stay at that pressure for as long as they want. To test this idea, SEALAB 1 was created.</p>
        <p>The reason the Space Race was mentioned was because it was a very big deal to the public and the United States as a nation. The Space Race news was all over the headlines
            and this is the reason the SEALAB experiments did not gain any public views. In 1964, Bob Barth, a participant of SEALAB 1, was a guest on a TV show called "Tell the Truth". During this episode
            there were three men, all presumably named Bob Barth. However, only one was the true Barth. The episode consisted of a host asking each Barth questions about the SEALAB
            experiments. At the end, a few people had to guess which one was the real Barth based on their answers to the questions. All but one guessed incorrectly. No one had seen 
            Bob Barth and almost no one had heard about these experiments. The aquanauts in this experiments did not get the kind of recognition that the astronauts got from the Space
            program. </p>
