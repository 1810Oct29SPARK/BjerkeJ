        <h2>SEALAB 2</h2>
        <p>On August 28th, 1965, the first group moved into SEALAB 2, or as they called it "Tilton Hilton. They nicknamed it this because of the sloped landscape it was on. 
            Each group of 10  divers spent 15 days at a depth of 62 meters off the coast of La Jolla, California. Aquanaut/astronaut Scott Carpenter stayed in the habitat for two sessions, totaling
            30 days underwater. Before his participation in the SEALAB experiments, he was involved in the Mercury 7 expedition. Having a taste of both space and the ocean, Carpenter would 
            say that many of the tasks he took on during the SEALAB program were more dangerous and more difficult than those in the space program. </p>
        <p>While the divers were in SEALAB 2, they gathered a lot of data about the physiology from living underwater. They also tested new underwater tools, new salvaging processes,
            and an electric dry suit.

            <p>While at higher temperatures, gases have different properties. The nitrogen we are used to breathing actually becomes poisonous, helium does not. The aquanauts had to breathe
                a mixture of oxygen and helium while underwater which gave their voices a new pitch. Below is an audio recording of a phone conversation between Carpenter and 
                President Lyndon B. Johnson. The operator had a very hard time figuring out what Carpenter was saying. This recording has become an iconic recollection of the SEALAB 
                experiments and could have been as memorable as Armstrong's quote as he steps on the moon if the experiments were not so well shadowed. </p>
